                What are the three main types of images used in HTML web pages?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                The three main types of images used in HTML web pages are JPEG,
                PNG, and SVG. A fourth popular image type is GIF.
              </dd>
              <dt>When would you use each type of the three images?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  <strong>JPEG</strong> (or Joint Photographic Expert Group -- I
                  didn't know this until today!) is best for photographs with
                  many colors, it's smaller size is an advantage for web use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>PNG</strong> (or Portable Network Graphics) is best
                  for images that require transparency or have text. It provides
                  better compression without losing quality, it is, however
                  larger in file size compared to JPEG.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>SVG</strong> (or Scalable Vector Graphics) is ideal
                  for logos, icons, and other graphics that need to be scaled
                  without losing quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>GIF</strong> (or Graphics Interchange Format) is used
                  for simple animations and images with more limited color
                  palettes.

              <dt>What is Copyright?</dt>
              <dd>
                Copyright is a type of legal protection that gives visual
                artists, writers, developers, and other creators of content the
                right to control the use and distribution of their work.
              </dd>
              <dt>What is Fair Use in terms of Copyright?</dt>
              <dd>
                Fair Use is an exception to copyright that allows for use of the
                copyrighted materials in specific circumstances such as for
                educational purposes, research, or commentary.

                  <strong>Creative Commons</strong> licenses give content
                  creators a standardized way for content creators to specify
                  how their works can be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Public Domain</strong> is a status where a work is no
                  longer protected by copyright and can be used for any purpose
                  without permission. It is granted either when the original
                  copyright expires or when the creator releases it into the
                  public domain.

              <dt>How can you be sure you have permission to use an image?</dt>
              <dd>
                To be sure that you have permission to use an image you can
                check the copyright status, this is frequently indicated on the
                image's source page or found in the image's exif data. You can
                also obtain permission directly from the image's creator.
                Finally, you can obtain your images from reputable stock image
                sites that grant free use rights.

              <dt>What is image compression/optimization?</dt>
              <dd>
                Image compression/optimization are processes used to reduce the
                file size of images.
              </dd>
              <dt>Why do we need to compress/optimize our images?</dt>
              <dd>
                We need to compress/optimize images so that they load more
                quickly and efficiently on web pages. There are two main types
                of image compression. Lossy compression removes data from an
                image that the human eye typically does not notice. It offers up
                to 90% reduction in file size, but can cause artifacting (or
                blurs) in the images. Lossless compression reduces the size of
                image files without removing data from the image, but the size
                of the reduction is significantly smaller, up to 30%.
