            <li>
              Place the butter in a small saucepan and set over medium low heat.
              Low heat is key to an even, golden browning! Use a silicone
              spatula to stir and scrape the butter from the bottom and sides of
              the pan every 10 to 15 seconds. At first, the butter will melt and
              foam, then over time the foam bubbles will get smaller and the
              butter will begin to emit a warm, nutty aroma. Continue to cook
              the butter, occasionally stirring and scraping with your spatula,
              until the butter begins to take on color and you see small
              floating brown bits, about 5 to 7 minutes (these are the milk
              solids in your butter separating and toasting). Once the butter is
              golden brown, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool in the
              saucepan for about 5 minutes. You want it to cool down enough that
              it's pretty warm, but not scalding hot to the touch.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown butter, brown sugar, and
              granulated sugar. Use a silicone spatula to mix together. Add the
              egg, extra egg yolk, and vanilla and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add in the flour, baking soda, salt and fold until no streaks of
              flour remain, being careful not to overmix your batter. The dough
              should be soft but not sticky, so when you touch it with your
              finger, it gives just a little.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Do not over
              mix. Cover the bowl and place it in the fridge to chill for at
              least 1 hour (and up to overnight).
            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment
              paper. Remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to soften at
              room temperature until it's scoopable (about 20 minutes). Use a 1
              ½ ounce cookie scoop to portion out equal amounts of dough. Place
              on the prepared baking sheets, spacing the dough 2 inches apart.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake until the cookies have puffed up and are light golden brown
              around the edges but still somewhat soft in the middle, 12 to 13
              minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, sprinkle with
              flaky sea salt (if using), and allow the cookies to cool slightly
              on the baking sheet before serving.
