## Assignment 01: Creating Basic HTML Elements

**[View Project Files](https://github.com/aeposten/csd112/tree/main/assignments/assignment-1)**

### Overview
This assignment focuses on the structural foundation of the web. I practiced using semantic HTML5 tags to ensure the document is readable by both browsers and assistive technologies.

### My Submission: Favorite Adventure Time Wizards
For this assignment, I created a page dedicated to the wizards of the *Adventure Time* universe. I used semantic sections to categorize each wizard and applied the required HTML elements to build out their lore.

#### "Magic Toggle"
While the assignment focused on HTML structure, I definitely went overboard. I have only written Python and Java since starting at LW Tech, and I REALLY miss web development, so I decided to add some CSS to the page for fun. I added a custom JavaScript function that allows users to "Disable Magic." By clicking the button in the navigation bar, all CSS is disabled, revealing the semantic HTML structure underneath. 

It also gave me some practice using the aria-pressed attribute.

#### Colors & Accessibility
I generated the fun, accessible color scheme using [Randoma11y](https://randoma11y.com/)!
