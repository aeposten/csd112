### My Submission: Favorite Adventure Time Wizards

For this assignment, I created a page dedicated to the wizards of the _Adventure Time_ universe. I used semantic sections to categorize each wizard and applied the required HTML elements to build out their lore.

#### "Magic Toggle"

While the assignment focused on HTML structure, I definitely went overboard. I have only written Python and Java since starting at LW Tech, and I REALLY miss web development, so I decided to add some CSS to the page for fun. I added a custom JavaScript function that allows users to "Disable Magic." By clicking the button in the navigation bar, all CSS is disabled, revealing the semantic HTML structure underneath.

It also gave me some practice using the aria-pressed attribute.

#### Colors & Accessibility

I generated the fun, accessible color scheme using [Randoma11y](https://randoma11y.com/)!

## Assignment 03: Styling a Recipe with CSS

**[View Assignment Files](https://github.com/aeposten/csd112/tree/main/assignments/assignment-3)**

### Overview

This assignment focused on applying CSS styling to a real-world content scenario: a recipe. The goal was to combine semantic HTML structure with internal CSS to create a visually styled, readable document while practicing different selector types and common CSS properties.

### Assignment Objectives

- Practice using internal CSS via the `<style>` tag
- Apply different types of CSS selectors
- Explore common CSS properties such as color, font size, spacing, and backgrounds
- Use semantic HTML to logically structure content

### Assignment Requirements

<details>
<summary>Click to view full requirements</summary>

- Create a properly structured semantic HTML document
- Correctly utilize at least three types of HTML elements
  - Examples: unordered lists for ingredients, ordered lists for steps, images for final results
- Use **internal CSS**, referenced in the `head` using the `<style>` tag
- Style at least one property using:
  - A **tag selector**
  - An **ID selector**
  - A **class selector**
- Apply styling to at least **four CSS properties overall**
  - Examples: `color`, `font-size`, `background-color`, `padding`
- Use a **real recipe**, not placeholder or filler text
- Cite the recipe source if a pre-existing recipe is used

</details>

### My Submission

For this assignment, I created a recipe page structured with semantic HTML elements to clearly separate ingredients, preparation steps, and supporting content. I used internal CSS to style the page and applied tag, class, and ID selectors to demonstrate different ways of targeting elements.

This assignment helped reinforce how CSS and HTML work together to transform a well-structured document into something visually engaging, while still maintaining accessibility and logical organization.

### Key Takeaways

Styling content effectively starts with strong semantic structure. Working with a real recipe emphasized the importance of choosing the correct HTML elements first, then layering CSS on top to improve readability, hierarchy, and overall user experience.
