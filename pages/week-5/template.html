        <p>
          All fonts that can be brought on to a web page fall into one of the
          five generic font families:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li id="serif">
            <b>Serif</b> — Serifs have a small stroke at the edges of each
            letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
          </li>
          <li id="sans-serif">
            <b>Sans Serif</b> — Sans serifs have clean lines, no small strokes
            (aka serifs) attached. They create a modern and minimalistic look.
          </li>
          <li id="monospace">
            <b>Monospace</b> — Monospace fonts have all letters with the same
            fixed width. They tend to create a mechanical look.
          </li>
          <li id="cursive">
            <b>Cursive / Script</b> — These imitate human handwriting and
            calligraphy. They are good for decorative elements and headlines.
          </li>
          <li id="fantasy">
            <b>Fantasy / Decorative</b> — These are playful and decorative
            fonts. They are also good for headlines and decorative elements.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Locally hosted fonts need to be declared early on with the
          <code>@font-face</code> rule in order to be utilized.
        </p>
